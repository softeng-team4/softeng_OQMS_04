TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 4)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 

5 stories committed vs. 3 done

- Total points committed vs. done 

25 points committed vs 22 done

- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)

53 hours planned vs 48 hours spent

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |         |       |            |              |
| Get a ticket     |    3     |    8    |       8     |       9       |
| Notify turn     |    3     |    3    |       10     |       3       |
| Show queue     |    3     |    3    |       5     |       3.5       |
| Show statistics     |    3     |    8    |       10     |       10.5      |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

Some of the tasks required more development effort and more discussion among teammates than expected, 
due to unforseen circumstances or tasks not thouroughly specified during the planning of the sprint

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

A lot more though needs to be put into the planning of the sprint, especially regarding the description of 
each task and the definition of the cross-cutting tasks. Also, prioritizing the user stories correctly can lead
to a more organic flow of developent.


- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

Properly defining the level of priority of each story; correctly identifying which tasks are cross-cutting

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

Despite some minor hiccups, the team got along well and each team member did their best on the tasks assigned.
