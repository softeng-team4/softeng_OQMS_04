TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 4)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 
  - 5 stories committed vs. 3 done

- Total points committed vs. done 
  - 25 points committed vs 22 done

- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)
  - 54 hours planned vs 45 hours spent

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story           | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| --------------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| _#0_            | 4       |        | 13         | 13           |
| Get a ticket    | 3       | 8      | 8          | 9            |
| Notify turn     | 3       | 3      | 10         | 3            |
| Show queue      | 3       | 3      | 5          | 3.5          |
| Show statistics | 3       | 8      | 10         | 10.5         |
| Next customer   | 3       | 3      | 8          | 6            |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  - Hours per task: 45 / 19 = 2.37
  - Estimated standard deviation: 6
  - Actual standard deviation: 13.33
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1
  - 54 / 45 - 1 = 0.23

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 11
  - Total hours spent ：5.33
  - Nr of automated unit test cases ：6 
  - Coverage (if available) : 57.14%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 3
  - Total hours spent : 1.5
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated ： 6
  - Total hours spent：4.17
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - Some of the tasks required more development effort and more discussion among teammates than expected, due to unforseen circumstances or tasks not thouroughly specified during the planning of the sprint;
  - The vague description of tasks leads to unclear job content. We should decide on a clear project structure, preferably a simple paper prototype to make the task clear when we did the organization.
  

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - A lot more though needs to be put into the planning of the sprint, especially regarding the description of each task and the definition of the cross-cutting tasks. Also, prioritizing the user stories correctly can lead to a more organic flow of developent.
  - When organizing, try to detail each task as much as possible. Schedule some code review tasks to merge each task.
  - Report the spent time with the work type would give our retrospective more helps.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  - Properly defining the level of priority of each story;
  - Correctly identifying which tasks are cross-cutting;
  - Put more effort in design;
  - Concentrate everyone on the higher priority tasks first, in order to do not waste anyone's work;

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

  - Despite some minor hiccups, the team got along well and each team member did their best on the tasks assigned.
  - Everyone was able to deliver a well working version of their tasks.
